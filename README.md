# IntergerWords.java
takes an integer and converts it to the “written out” version.
 Numbers can be written using numeric characters (1, 23, 19, 215 
etc.) but they can also be “written out” in English (one, twenty three, nineteen, two hundred fifteen, etc.). Write a class IntegerWords in the file IntegerWords.java that can convert from numbers, into “written out” English. 
Your class should have the following specific details:
(a) It should have at least one instance variable private String w which should store the “written out” version of the number.
(b) It should have a constructor that takes an integer and converts it to the “written out” version.
(c) It should have a toString()method that returns the written out version of the number as a String.
Converting all the integers is too tedious. Your class needs to only operate 
correctly for all three digit numbers [0, 999] inclusive. You should also write a 
main method in a separate file (IntegerWordsTest.java) to demonstrate that your 
class works for all the numbers from 0 to 999!
